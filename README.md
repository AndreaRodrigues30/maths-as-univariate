# Working with univariate data

## snake

* Use the game of snake (no, not *that* snake) to generate data for analysis
* Write functions to calculate the mean, mode and media

## snake meets pandas

* Use `pandas` to visualise and analyse

## exploring height data
* Use `pandas` to interrogate a simple data set
* Use the `quantile` function to find and interpret percentiles, deciles &c

## state troopers
* Data from [this task](https://www.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/tasks/1027)

## some random numbers
* Two sets of random data with suspiciously similar summary statistics, including the IQR. Use `pandas` `df.hist()` to see how different the distributions are. Why was it so easy to fool the IQR? What can we do about it?

## temperature
* Dealing with badly presented data
* Measuring *unusualness*

### To do

* Write functions to represent different snake strategies so we can evaluate them
