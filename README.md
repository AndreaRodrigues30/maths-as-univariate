# Working with univariate data

Done

* Use the game of snake (no, not *that* snake) to generate data for analysis
* Use `numpy` and `toyplot` to process and visualise the data

To do

* Write functions to represent different strategies so we can evaluate them
* Use `pandas` to offload some of the work
