# Working with univariate data

## snake

* Use the game of snake (no, not *that* snake) to generate data for analysis
* Use `numpy` and `toyplot` to process and visualise the data
* Write functions to calculate the mean, mode and media

## snake meets pandas

* Use `pandas` to offload some of the work

## exploring height data
* Use `pandas` to interrogate a simple data set
* Use the `quantile` function to find and interpret percentiles, deciles &c

### To do

* Write functions to represent different snake strategies so we can evaluate them
* Does `numpy.histogram` necessarily create a histogram as we understand it? Can we make it do that?
